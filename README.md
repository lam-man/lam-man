### Hi there, I'm Wen 👋

I am a passionate software engineer at Microsoft. I have a great interest in the following areas: Distributed System, Software Architecture, Open Source, and Software Engineering. Figuring out how a system works from end to end is intriguing to me. To satify my curiosity, I co-host [SPLVM](https://microsoft-distributed-system-meetup.github.io/database-meetup/) (System & Programming Language Virtual Meetup) with my friends. In the current phase, we are learning Database System. 

- 📖 WebAssembly: The Definitive Guide & Designing Data-Intensive Applications
- 🔭 Dive into Kubernetes
- 🗣️ I regularly present in the current database meetup. 
- 📢 What I believe: There is no loser in a winning team and there is no winner in a losing team.
